# C++ Programs
This is a collection of programs and samples code demonstrating my C++ programing skills.

## Projects Included
- Budget Creator Program
  This program uses loop sentienels to safely excute and operate while loops while taking user inputs for their desired budget and number of expenses per month.
  Uses input validation to ensure proper user inputs and if else statements to tell user if they are on budget, over or excatly on the budget.

- Test Score Analyzing Program
  This program uses linear arrays to store student names, their test scores and create student ids for them.
  It also ulitizes multiple addiation linear arrays to create averages for the students, assign letter grades and allow for linear searching of indiviual students based on their id.
  Uses functions to prompt user inputs and ensure input validations.
